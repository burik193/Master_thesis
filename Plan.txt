1. Preprocess your data: Clean and standardize the names you want to match and the validated names list. This step includes converting names to lowercase, removing special characters, etc.

2. Generate Features: Transform the names into a numerical representation, such as a character-level or word-level encoding. This representation will be the input to your neural network.

3. Design Neural Network: Choose an appropriate architecture for your problem, such as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

4. Train the Model: Train the model using the preprocessed data and generated features. Use a loss function, such as categorical cross-entropy or binary cross-entropy, that measures the difference between the predicted and actual values.

5. Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

6. Deploy the Model: Deploy the trained model in a production environment for matching names with mistyped characters against the validated names list.
